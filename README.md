# How to test a .NET 8 web api with Mongo

This is an example project on how to test a .NET web api that connects to a mongo database. I wanted to highlight how to handle dependency injection, setting up a mock mongo db with data, and how to pull data from that database.

[This is an article](https://medium.com/@jwag/how-to-write-unit-tests-for-a-net-8-web-api-with-mongodb-and-dependency-injection-b0e33938f1b0) that covers everything.
